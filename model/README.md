# Crop Disease Detection Model

This model trained with Tensorflow classifies various types of crops images (corn, wheat, rice, potato) according to their health (healthy vs various types of diseases).

In these folder you will find:

* The notebook used to train the model, along with requirements in Pipfile
* The code to create a container image to serve this model with FastAPI

Not included:

* The dataset for training, too big to be included in the repo, is available here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafishamoin/new-bangladeshi-crop-disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafishamoin/new-bangladeshi-crop-disease)
* The trained model, again too big for GitHub, can be downloaded here: TBD. The model has to be added to the container folder to build it.
